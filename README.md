# Game_Brick_Breaker

A classic Brick Breaker (Breakout-style) game implemented in Python. Bounce the ball off a paddle to break bricks, and try to clear levels while maximizing your score.

## Features
- Paddle controlled by the player
- Ball physics and collisions with walls, paddle, and bricks
- Multiple brick types (single-hit, multi-hit, etc.)
- Score and lives system
- Sound effects and simple UI

## Preview
Add a screenshot or GIF to docs/ or assets/ and replace the path below:

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- pygame

If your repository includes a requirements.txt or other dependency file, use that. Otherwise install pygame:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SyedAhm4d/Game_Brick_Breaker.git
cd Game_Brick_Breaker
```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
# If there's a requirements.txt:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or install pygame directly:
pip install pygame
```

## Run the game

Run the project's main script. Common entrypoint names:

```bash
python main.py
# or
python game.py
# or for a src/ layout:
python -m src.main
```

If your repository uses a different entrypoint, replace the command above with the correct filename/module.

## Controls (common defaults)
- Left / Right arrow keys: Move paddle
- A / D: Move paddle (alternative)
- Space: Launch ball / Start level
- P: Pause
- Esc / Q: Quit

Check the input-handling section of your code for exact key bindings.

## Gameplay
- Objective: Destroy all bricks on the screen without losing all lives.
- Lives: You lose a life when the ball falls beneath the paddle.
- Score: Points awarded per brick; special bricks/power-ups may grant bonuses.
- Power-ups: Some bricks may drop power-ups (expand paddle, multi-ball, slow ball, extra life).

## Project structure (example)
Adjust these paths to match your repository structure:

- main.py — Game entrypoint
- src/ — Source code (game logic, sprites, levels)
- assets/ or resources/ — Images, sounds, fonts
- docs/ — Screenshots, design notes
- levels/ — Level definitions or layouts
- requirements.txt — Python dependencies

## Configuration & Tuning
Look for a file like config.py, settings.py, or constants.py to change:
- Paddle size and speed
- Ball speed and physics
- Starting lives
- Score values

To add levels, check for level files or the code that constructs brick layouts.

## Debugging & Development Tips
- Use small test levels to debug collision and physics logic.
- Print or log ball/paddle positions and collision events to verify behavior.
- Isolate physics, rendering, and input handling into separate modules for easier testing.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Typical workflow:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch: git checkout -b feature/my-feature
3. Commit your changes with clear messages
4. Open a pull request describing the change and rationale

When opening issues or PRs, include:
- Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Platform, Python, and pygame versions
